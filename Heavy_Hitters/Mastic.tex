\section{Summary}
\underline{Heavy Hitters Problem}: Millions of clients with each client holding an n-bit string. 2 data collection servers that learn the set of strings $\ge$ t clients hold.\\

\underline{Weighted Heavy Hitters Problem}: Each input $\alpha$ held by a client is associated with a weight $\beta$ and the servers' goal is to compute subset of inputs for which (some function) the sum of the weights exceeds T.\\

\underline{Example of Weighted Heavy Hitters}: If each input is a site visited by a user, then the weight might represent the time spend on the site by that user; and the T-weighted heavy hitters would represent the sites with the highest engagement (i.e. time spent on the site).

\subsection{Contributions of Mastic}
\begin{enumerate}
   \item \textbf{Weighted Heavy Hitters}: First to solved weighted heavy hitters (not supported by Prio or Poplar)
   \item \textbf{Attribute based Metrics}: Concrete improvements over Prio and Poplar in grouping general-purpose metrics by user attributes such as geographic location, browser version etc.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Private network error logging
        \item Browser telemetry
    \end{itemize}
    \item Secure in same threat model as Poplar (2 Servers, Privacy of inputs in presence of Malicious clients + 1 Malicious Server, Robustness of output in presence of Malicious clients)
    \item Technique improvement over Poplar:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In Poplar, servers interactively compute arithmetic sketch over their shares to verify that their shares of $f_{\alpha, \beta}(x)$ for each candidate prefix x add up to a valid value. Requires 2 rounds of communication.
        \item Mastic uses VIDPF (Verifiable IDPF, first introduced in PLASMA) based on hashing, lower communication, 1 round of communication.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Remarks}
Poplar, PLASMA, Mastic are DP compatible, can be modified to report differentially private aggregations.

\section{Primitives}
\subsection{VIDPF}
Poplar : Mastic :: IDPF + Malicious Secure Sketching : VIDPF \\

where VIDPF = Antigoni's VDPF technique (extending leaf layer such that right children hold a sharing of 0, checking if shares of right children are equal) \\

Security in Random Oracle model \\

VIDPF in Mastic uses sum of weights rather prefix counts during tree traversal, to use compute subset of inputs whose total weight exceeds desired threshold. \\

\underline{Security Properties}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Correctness: When clients and servers (aggregators) are honest, servers correctly evaluate share of prefix tree.
    \item Verifiability: When servers are honest, malicious clients cannot construct a public share and keys $(pub, key_0, key_1)$ for which evaluation tree contains more than 1 non-zero node at any level $k \in [n]$
    \item Privacy: Info revealed to each server reveals nothing about honest client's input
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Shared ZK Proofs}
Security in Random Oracle model. \\

\underline{Security Properties}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Completeness: When the client and servers (aggregators) are honest, servers accept the client value. 
    \item Soundness: When servers are honest, invalid client values are detected with high probability
    \item Zero-Knowledge: When client and at least 1 server is honest, execution of the proof system reveals nothing about the client value beyond its validity.
\end{enumerate}
