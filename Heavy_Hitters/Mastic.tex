\section{Summary}
\underline{Heavy Hitters Problem}: Millions of clients with each client holding an n-bit string. 2 data collection servers that learn the set of strings $\ge$ t clients hold.\\

\underline{Weighted Heavy Hitters Problem}: Each input $\alpha$ held by a client is associated with a weight $\beta$ and the servers' goal is to compute subset of inputs for which (some function) the sum of the weights exceeds T.\\

\underline{Example of Weighted Heavy Hitters}: If each input is a site visited by a user, then the weight might represent the time spend on the site by that user; and the T-weighted heavy hitters would represent the sites with the highest engagement (i.e. time spent on the site).

\underline{Contributions of Mastic}:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item First to solved weighted heavy hitters (not supported by Prio or Poplar)
   \item Concrete improvements over Prio and Poplar in grouping general-purpose metrics by user attributes such as geographic location, browser version etc.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Private network error logging
        \item Browser telemetry
    \end{itemize}
    \item Secure in same threat model as Poplar
    \item Technique improvement over Poplar:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In Poplar, servers interactively compute arithmetic sketch over their shares to verify that their shares of $f_{\alpha, \beta}(x)$ for each candidate prefix x add up to a valid value. Requires 2 rounds of communication.
        \item Mastic uses VIDPF (Verifiable IDPF, first introduced in PLASMA) based on efficient hashing techniques that provide a stronger and intuitive verifiability property with lower communication overhead.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
