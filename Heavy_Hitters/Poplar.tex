\section{Summary}
\underline{Heavy Hitters Problem}: Millions of clients with each client holding an n-bit string. 2 data collection servers that learn the set of strings >=t clients hold.

\underline{Applications}:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item Which URLs crash Firefox most often? 
   \item Which phone apps consume the most battery life?
   \item Which passwords are most popular?
   \item Which programs consume the most CPU?
   \item Where do users of my app spend their time?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Warm Up Scheme}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Client i with string $s_i$ prepares a binary tree with 1s on the path to $s_i$-th leaf of the tree.
    \item Each client secret shares labels on the tree's nodes and sends one share to each of the servers. 
    \item Servers sum up shares from each client to get "aggregate" shares.
    \item Servers publish shares to perform BFS search for heavy hitters
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Root node consists of share of no. of clients starting with empty string
        \item Left child of root node consists of share of no. of clients starting with 0
        \item Right child of root node consists of share of no. of clients starting with 1
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{How can the clients materialize an exponentially large tree?}
They can use Incremental Distributed Point Functions (IDPFs): Succint sharing of a tree with non-zero path.

\underline{Communication}: $O(\lambda n)$ instead of $O (\lambda n^2)$ (with normal DPFs)

\subsection{How to prevent client from sending malformed shares?}
They can use Malicious secure sketching. Servers can test whether a secret shared vector is non-zero in a single coordinate. No interaction with client. $O(\lambda n)$ communication between servers. Also extractable DPFs are used.
